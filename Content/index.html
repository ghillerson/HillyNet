            <p>I am an information architect, a technical writer, and an ex-software engineer. I've lived in the Santa Cruz, California area since 1975. I enjoy organizing chaotic information into structures that make sense to whatever audience is using that information. I think of technical writing as a different version of programming:&#160;one in which the programming language is English, and the classes and modules are chapters and topics.</p>
            <p>In recent years, I've become an expert in using MadCap Flare for various writing and web development projects, including an extensive documentation system for a Big Data database company, an online learning course in Music Theory, and the web and help system for an academic software company. Prior to using Flare, I&#160;gained proficiency in DreamWeaver, FrameMaker, and Word.</p>
            <h2>Technical Writing and Information Architect Work History</h2>
            <p>In 1989, I switched from programming to writing technical documentation for software engineers. The reason was quite simple:&#160;I was burning out from my compulsive relationship to solving coding problems, and realized that I&#160;needed to find a way to relativize my relationship to software. I've been glad of it every since.</p>
            <h2>Programming Work History</h2>
            <p>I&#160;began my programming career in the 1970s, received my degree in Computer and&#160;Information Sciences from UC&#160;Santa Cruz in 1979, and worked as a primary software engineer for Silicon Valley startups through the 1980s. My specialty was designing and implementing graphically-oriented user interfaces at a time when the command line still ruled.</p>
            <p>I worked closely with several industry "heavies"&#160;back in those days, notably Sharon Sickel Beach, who was my thesis advisor and UCSC, and with whom I&#160;worked as a consulting software engineer for several years. When Sharon joined a startup as VP&#160;of engineering in the mid-1980s, I&#160;became her lead software engineer and helped to redesign a integrated</p>
            <p>From 1982 until 2014, I worked as a consultant/contractor in Silicon Valley, both as a programmer and technical writer. I was one of three founders of Team Engineering, which enjoyed a good run developing graphic user interface tools in the 1980s. In 1992, I started, developed, and managed StyleEase Software, which grew out of a tool I developed when writing my Master's thesis into a very successful small software company that enjoyed a 15+ year run before running out of steam.</p>
            <p>My professional and personal experience history is detailed in the <a href="Intro.Experience.html">Experience</a> section of this web.</p>
            <h2>Other Interesting Tidbits</h2>
            <p>In 1989, I returned to graduate school to study psychology, with the intention of working as a therapist with software engineers. I&#160;practiced part-time as a <a href="Therapist.html">psychotherapist</a> for more than 15 years.</p>
            <p>In 1998, I developed an interest in <a href="Bookbinder.html">classical bookbinding</a> and studied privately with a local and very well known book artist in Santa Cruz. I became a member of the Bookbinder's Guide, was a featured artist in several Hand Bookbinder's Association shows in San Francisco, and have been part of several local Artist Open Studios events.</p>
            <p>I&#160;trained as a classical pianist in my early years, and continue to play regularly, along with enjoying Afro-Cuban drumming, and a stint as a jegog player in a performing gamelan group.</p>
