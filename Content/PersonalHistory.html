            <h2>Education</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Master of Arts in Counseling Psychology from Pacifica Graduate Institute, Santa Barbara, CA., 1992</p>
                <p>Bachelor of Arts in Information and Computer Sciences, Summa Cum Laude, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA., 1979</p>
                <p>I attended school through high school in my hometown, in the suburbs of Philadelphia. I enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh to study creative writing, but dropped out after 3 semesters to pursue other interests. </p>
                <p>I&#160;moved to Santa Cruz, California, in September of 1975, and enrolled at UCSC, originally to study solar energy. I got hooked on Computer Science after studying compiler writing with Frank DeRemer and predicate logic with Sharon Sickel. My thesis project was writing a bootstrapped microprocessor-based predicate logic interpreter. I&#160;graduated from UCSC, with highest honors.</p>
                <p>In 1989, I decided to attend graduate school to study counseling psychology, with the intention of becoming a psychotherapist who specializes in working with programmers. I graduated, with highest honors, from Pacifica Graduate Institute, one of the best regarded Jungian psychology programs in the world, where my Master's Thesis was about drum circles as a model of group interaction.</p>

            <h2>Personal Information</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>I grew up in the suburbs of Philadelphia, and survived high school in the late sixties. My father was the town veterinarian, and instilled a love of animals in my three siblings and me. </p>
                <p>My first marriage lasted eighteen years and produced two lovely daughters who have both become wonderful adults. I&#160;married my partner, Susan Parrish, in 2009, and look forward to enjoying time with her for the rest of our lives.</p>

            <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>I've studied classical piano since I was four years old, and continue to play on an almost-daily basis. I'm also a fairly decent Afro-Cuban style hand drummer, and can play a few tunes on guitar as well.</p>
                <p>My wife and I&#160;love heading over to Hawaii, especially the north shore of Kauai. We started kayaking over there (in Kealakekua Bay on the Big Island of Hawaii), and now head out on regular kayak adventures in the waters in and surrounding the Monterey Bay near where we live.</p>
                <p>I studied classical, French-style bookbinding for a number of years, and have continued to create innovative blank books and boxes since then. See my <a href="Bookbinder.html">bookbinding page</a> for examples of books and boxes I've created over the years.</p>
                <p>I'm an avid reader, movie watcher, gardener, and music listener.&#160;You'll find me walking my golden retriever, Bonnie, on local beaches at least several times a week.</p>
