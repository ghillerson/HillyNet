            <h2>Senior Technical Writer, Splice Machine, 2014-present</h2>
            <p>I&#160;was hired as a contractor in 2013 at Splice Machine to develop documentation for their nascent big data relational database system. I&#160;became a full-time employee at Splice Machine in March, 2014. Since then, I&#160;have been the sole developer and writer for the company, creating a suite of five books comprising almost one thousand topics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="italic">Getting Started with Splice Machine</li>
                <li class="italic">Developer's Guide to Splice Machine</li>
                <li class="italic">Splice Machine Administrator's Guide</li>
                <li class="italic">Installation Guide for Splice Machine</li>
                <li class="italic">Splice Machine SQL&#160;Reference Manual</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We've used MadCap Flare as our writing tool, which has allowed us to easily package all of the books into a single, responsive web site, <a href="http://doc.splicemachine.com/">doc.splicemachine.com</a>, and to also offer each book as a downloadable PDF.</p>
            <p>Writing the documentation for Splice Machine has primarily involved working with the developers, and meeting with product management and customer solutions managers to help shape the design and delivery of the content. </p>
