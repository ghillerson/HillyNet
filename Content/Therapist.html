            <p>In 1988, I&#160;decided to return to graduate school to study psychology and become a Marriage and Family Therapist, with the intention of helping software engineers to learn how to balance their work and home lives. I&#160;graduated in 1991 from Pacifica Graduate Institute, one of the premier Jungian-oriented psychology graduate programs in the United States.</p>
            <p>From 1991 until 2008, I&#160;worked part-time as a psychotherapist, both with individual clients and with groups. My specialty was helping men to become more aware of their emotional lives. I&#160;also ran two longstanding and rewarding groups with high-functioning men who worked in high tech jobs.</p>
