            <h1 class="homePageSubTitle">Programming Experience</h1>
            <h2>Chief Developer, StyleEase Software, LLC, 1991-2015</h2>
            <p>I&#160;created StyleEase Software in 1991 to help graduate students to write correctly formatted academic papers in American Psychological Association (APA)&#160;format. </p>
            <p>StyleEase was a very large and highly successful Visual Basic project, running as an add-on in versions of Microsoft Word from Word 6 up to Word 2016. </p>
            <h2>Lead Programmer, Graphics and User Interface, Team Engineering, Inc., 1982-1988</h2>
            <p>Three of us started Team Engineering in the early days of graphical workstations, to develop tools that enabled engineers to retrofit modern, graphical user interfaces onto existing command-line oriented programs. I&#160;was the graphics and user interface developer, working in tandem with a back-end engineer who converted user input into the command lines expected by these programs. Our product, the Tiger User Interface tool, was used by major research labs around the world during the transition from command line to modern interfaces.</p>
            <h2>Software Engineering Manager, CTX, Inc. 1981-1982</h2>
            <p>I was hired to lead a team of software engineers in developing a more methodical and efficient approach to developing and maintaining CTX's software, which was widely used by semiconductor manufacturers to monitor integrated circuit manufacturing processes. CTX&#160;was bought by Motorola in 1982.</p>
            <h2>Software Consultant, Logical Paradox, Inc., 1980-1981</h2>
            <p>I worked with Sharon Sickel-Beach, who had been my professor and thesis advisor at UCSC, to develop a graphical, predicate logic programming language. We were working directly for the head of advanced technology at Burroughs Corporation.</p>
            <h2>Graphics and User Interface Programmer, Avera Corp., 1979-1980</h2>
            <p>I was the initial software engineer hired by Avera in 1979, as they set out to create the first microprocessor-based workstation for designing integrated circuits. My job was to develop the user interface and graphics engine, working in tandem with the hardware engineers who were creating our workstations. I also co-wrote the Pascal compiler that Avera used for writing all application software.</p>
