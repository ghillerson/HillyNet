            <h1 class="homePageSubTitle">Bookbinding Projects</h1>
            <p>I've been practicing the fine craft of bookbinding since 1995. I've been a member of the Hand Bookbinder's Guild, and apprenticed with local bookbinding wizard Constance Hunter from 1999 til 2003.</p>
            <p>I've designed numerous fine journals using various binding techniques, including Coptic  bindings, library bindings, medieval-style flexible bindings, and case-bound  bindings. I've also restored a number of fine, older books, using classical binding techniques, including paring and tooling of fine leather. He also creates custom boxes of all sorts. </p>
            <p>Though no longer selling my bookbinding services, I continue to pursue the craft as a hobby, creating and restoring books and boxes for friends and family.</p>
            <h2>Full Leather Binding</h2>
            <p>This is a full leather binding with Moroccan grained goatskin and calfskin Chinese character onlay. A hinged box that holds the book is made of buckram and handmade paper, featuring the same Chinese character onlaid on its spine:</p>

            <h2>Printed Canvas Cover</h2>
            <p>This book features a canvas cover with inkjet-printed image (of a Buddhist Thanga). The cover was printed with archival inks, preserved with varnish, and waxed. It is bound using an Ethiopian Coptic, exposed spine binding:</p>

            <h2>Rebound First Edition</h2>
            <p>This is one of two volumes of the personal memoirs of U.S. Grant, signed by U.S. himself in 1885;. The covers were deteriorating, and the text block was sagging. I resewed the books on cords, created new goatskin covers, added handmade marbled flyleafs and fresh, gold-leafed labels:</p>
